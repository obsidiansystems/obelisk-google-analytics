# Obelisk Google Analytics

Add google analytics tracking to your obelisk apps. Automatically sends
`pageview` information when routes change.

## Setup

Go to https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/ and setup your account. This
will give you a Google analytics tracking ID, which you should put into a file
located at:

```
config/frontend/google/analytics/tracking-id
```
